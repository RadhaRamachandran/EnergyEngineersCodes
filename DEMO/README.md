####This DEMO was put together for the Open House at the CenterSpace (15th Sept 2016)

This folder contains python programs that show the individual capabilities of 4 different models of lamps. 

###Model 1: Starter kit

This is a single strip of 10 LEDs. Students will begin learning to code using this strip and then move on to other models. The files for the starter kit are in the DEMO folder.  Instructions for how to get started with the programming and what each of the python programs do, refer to Instructions1x10LEDS.pdf. 

*This uses the bibliopixel library. (https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel)*

###Model 2: Maker kit

This is 10 strips of 10 LEDs. These can be combined together to form a matrix 2-D display. This model is more versatile and allows to explore different possibilities for display and programming. This kit is also used to display live-streaming data (such as Twitter data, Smart meter electricity data) that the students learn to read and process. Examples of programs written by students are provided in the folder called *10x10* along with their description in 10x10Demo.pdf

###Model 3: Advanced display kit

This kit contains the Adafruit RGB matrix (32x32). This is an exploratory project. This setup will be used to create more advanced displays. Instructions on setting up and driving these matrices can he found here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi/overview

Sample programs, in the folder named *Matrix* were taken from https://github.com/adafruit/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/

###Model 4: 2-Tier version (OLD)

This is a model of that lamp that was built as an exploratory makerspace project. It contains a boxed enclosure for holding the Raspberry pi along with 2 strips of 40 LEDs in two different levels. This can be used to compare two different data sets. One sample program that reads and displays Twitter data has been added in the folder called *2-Tier*
