This DEMO was put together for the Open House at the CenterSpace (15th Sept 2016)

This folder contains python programs that show the individual capabilities of 4 different models of lamps. 

Model 1: Starter kit. 
This is a single strip of 10 LEDs. Students will begin learning to code using this strip and then move on to other models. The files for the starter kit are in the DEMO folder.
